  <p>Soprano Ewa Vesin commands a distinguished position among the Polish foremost classical singers. After her successful debut in ‘Die Walküre’, the Wagner Society announced:</p>
  <blockquote>“It was well worth the journey to Wrocław merely to hear and see a superlative performance of Sieglinde by Ewa Vesin, whose warm, bright voice and superb acting conveyed every nuance of the role. She was consummate in communicating all aspects of her part, including the pathos, indeed the monstrousness of her marriage, the hope of better future with the unknown fugitive, her despair at his death, and her joy when she learns she is carrying his child. Ewa Vesin not only looked every inch the part, but used her voice to such good effect that one was not obliged to make allowances for size, age, or lack of breath control. An altogether outstanding performance.”<footer>Wagner News 2007</footer></blockquote>
